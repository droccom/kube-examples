// Package ovs defines a network fabric that implements k8s.io/examples/staging/kos/pkg/networkfabric.Interface .
//
// The fabric is thread-safe.
//
// The fabric is based on an Open vSwitch (OvS) bridge, which gets configured
// through OpenFlow.
//
//******************************************************************************
// Currently, THE FABRIC DOES NOT WORK IF ANOTHER OvS BRIDGE EXISTS ON THE NODE.
// DOES NOT WORK means that its behavior is incorrect and undefined. Until this
// limitation is removed, users must ensure there's no other OvS bridge on the
// node.
//******************************************************************************
//
// The fabric constructor's creates the OvS bridge and a Network Interface
// configured to act as a VXLAN Tunnel End Point (VTEP), and connects them
// together. It also installs some default OpenFlow flows in the bridge.
// All these operations are idempotent so that it is safe for the process that
// uses the fabric to restart after a failure and re-instantiate the fabric.
// This is important because the bridge and the VTEP outlive the process that
// created them.
//
// If multiple processes using an OvS fabric ran at the same time on the same
// node, each fabric would configure the same OvS bridge without realizing
// another fabric is doing the same. This can lead to severe errors and
// misconfigurations. It is up to users of the fabric to ensure that they are
// the only process on their node that is using an OvS fabric.
//
// A local Network Interface is implemented as Linux network device connected
// to the bridge and three OpenFlow flows that allow the network device to send
// and receive traffic. One flow encapsulates all traffic coming from the Linux
// network device in a VXLAN packet, one flow forwards ARP requests for the
// Network Interface IP and VNI to the Linux network device, one flow forwards
// normal Layer 2 frames for the Network Interface MAC address and VNI to the
// Linux network device.
// The flows are added/removed atomically to/from the bridge, but the creation
// of the Linux network device and the addition of the flows are not executed
// atomically. If an error occurs after the creation of the Linux network
// device but before (or during) the addition of the flows, a one-shot attempt
// to delete the Linux network device is done; if it fails the fabric gives up
// and an incomplete implementation of the Network Interface is left on the node.
// Another case where an incomplete implementation of a local Network Interface
// is left on the node is when the process that uses this fabric crashes between
// creation of the Linux network device and addition of the flows.
// `ListLocalIfcs()`, the method that returns all the existing local network
// Interfaces in the bridge, queries the bridge OpenFlow flows and Linux network
// devices and tries to pair them, each pairing is then parsed into the
// appropriate `k8s.io/examples/staging/kos/pkg/networkfabric.LocalNetIfc`.
// `ListLocalIfcs()` might find incomplete implementations, that is, Linux
// network devices connected to the bridge for whom OpenFlow flows are not in
// the bridge; the reasons that can lead to such incomplete implementations were
// given earlier in this paragraph. In such cases, an attempt to clean up the
// incomplete implementation is made by deleting the Linux network device; only
// one try is made, if it fails, the incomplete implementation is left on the
// node and no error is returned.
//
//
// A remote Network Interface is implemented as two OpenFlow flows. One flow
// sends ARP requests for the remote Network Interface IP and VNI to the
// remote Network Interface host through the VTEP of the fabric's bridge. The
// other flow does the same thing, except for Layer 2 frames for the Network
// Interface MAC address and VNI instead of ARP requests. The two flows are
// added/removed atomically to/from the fabric's bridge.
// `ListRemoteIfcs()`, the method that returns all the existing remote Network
// Interfaces in the bridge, simply queries the bridge for all the OpenFlow
// flows and parses the flows that were added for a remote Network Interface
// into the appropriate `k8s.io/examples/staging/kos/pkg/networkfabric.RemoteNetIfc`.
//
//
// Currently, all operations on the bridge are done using the OvS CLI (through
// Golang's os.Exec).
//
// To be able to create an ovs network fabric in an application, you need to
// import package ovs in the main package of the application. This ensures that
// the factory which creates ovs network fabrics is registered in the network
// fabric factory registry, and can therefore be used to instantiate network
// fabrics.
package ovs // import "k8s.io/examples/staging/kos/pkg/networkfabric/ovs"
